=head1 NAME

abandon-comaint - Abandon comaint of a module on PAUSE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  abandon-comaint App::ForkProve [ Catalyst::Model::Akismet ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<abandon-comaint> is a command-line script to automate the process of logging
in to PAUSE and giving up co-maint that some other PAUSE author gave you.

The script will automatically fetch the list of packages included in
the distribution that the given module belongs to. For example, if you run:

  abandon-comaint Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy

it will gather all packages included in the
Plack-Middleware-ReverseProxy distribution, and try to give up
comaint for all of them.

The script is written in a defensive manner so that if you specify a
module that you don't have a primary maintainership on, it will complain
about that.

There's also a prompt before actually giving up co-maint.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

=over 4

=item *

You have to have a CPAN mirror cache in C<~/.cpanm> to find the
related packages. You can run `cpanm --mirror-only strict` once to get
that cache.

=item *

Your PAUSE credentials have to be saved in C<~/.pause> file, the same
as the one used by CPAN uploader.
